            <p id="early-life">
              Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner,<br>
              Middlesex, England. From a young age, he showed remarkable talent for music,<br> 
              teaching himself to play the piano by ear. Supported by his mother but<br>
              discouraged by his strict father, Elton found comfort and expression through<br> 
              music, performing at family gatherings and local pubs.

            <p id="career-legacy">
              Elton’s breakthrough came in the early 1970s with hits like Your Song and Rocket<br> 
              Man. Known for his powerful voice, flamboyant stage presence, and emotional<br>
              songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin, he became one of the best-selling<br> 
              artists of all time. Over his career, he has earned countless awards, including<br> 
              Grammys, an Oscar, and a knighthood. Beyond his music, Elton is celebrated for his<br> 
              advocacy and charity work, particularly in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
